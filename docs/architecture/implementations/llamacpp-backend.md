# OdaiLlamaEngine — llama.cpp Backend Implementation

**Interface**: [`IOdaiBackendEngine`](../interfaces/backend-engine.md)  
**Header**: [`src/include/backendEngine/odai_llamacpp/odai_llama_backend_engine.h`](../../src/include/backendEngine/odai_llamacpp/odai_llama_backend_engine.h)  
**Implementation**: `src/impl/backendEngine/odai_llamacpp/`  
**CMake Guard**: `ODAI_ENABLE_LLAMA_BACKEND`

## Overview

Uses [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) for LLM inference and the experimental `mtmd` (multimodal) API for image and audio inputs. Supports decoder-only LLMs in GGUF format.

## Hardware Discovery

During `initialize_engine()`, the engine discovers available hardware using GGML's backend system. Backend registration is done through `ggml_backend_load_all_from_path()` so ggml can score and load the best variant of each available backend family from the runtime backend directory.

Discovery is split into two internal concerns:

- **Device inventory**: store each accepted candidate as both public `BackendDevice` info and the private `ggml_backend_dev_t` handle needed by later placement and load decisions
- **Probe policy**: decide which backend families to query, in what order, for the requested device class

Current discovery policy is:

- **AUTO**: probe prioritized GPU backends, then fall back directly to CPU
- **GPU**: probe prioritized GPU backends only
- **IGPU**: probe prioritized iGPU backends only
- **CPU**: probe the CPU backend directly

Notes:

- **Desktop AUTO** does not run a second iGPU-only pass after GPU probing fails
- Discovery logs both the configured probe order and the per-backend probe result counts so later placement behavior can be explained without mixing discovery into load heuristics
- The Vulkan-on-Android device-class nuance is documented in [`nuances.md`](../../nuances.md#llamacpp-vulkan-device-type-on-android-and-other-integrated-gpus)

## LLM Placement Planning

Base LLM loading now runs through an internal `LlmLoadPlan` before calling `llama_model_load_from_file()`. The planner keeps placement policy separate from load execution and records the reason for the selected placement.

Current planning policy is:

- **Explicit CPU**: materialize a CPU-only plan directly
- **Apple / Android unified-memory platforms**: use the first accelerated candidate for full offload
- **Desktop dGPU**: query fresh free VRAM, choose the minimum fitting subset when possible, otherwise pass all discovered dGPUs for best-effort partial offload
- **Desktop iGPU**: require a full-fit free-memory check, otherwise fall back to CPU
- **No accelerator candidate**: materialize an explicit CPU-only plan instead of relying on llama.cpp defaults

The plan currently carries:

- placement mode (`CPU_ONLY`, `ACCELERATED_FULL`, `ACCELERATED_PARTIAL`)
- selected candidate-device indices
- `n_gpu_layers`, `split_mode`, `use_mmap`, and `use_mlock`
- a human-readable reason string used in runtime logs

The dGPU versus iGPU rationale for this split lives in [`nuances.md`](../../nuances.md#desktop-gpu-placement-uses-different-dgpu-and-igpu-rules).

## Model Caching

The engine caches the currently loaded LLM and embedding model (`m_llmModel`, `m_embeddingModel`). If a generation call requests the same model that's already loaded, it skips reloading.

### Expected Model Files

| Model Type | Required Entries | Optional Entries |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM** | `base_model_path` | `mmproj_model_path` (multimodal projector) |
| **Embedding** | `base_model_path` | _(none)_ |

## Multimodal Support

When `mmproj_model_path` is registered, the engine creates an `mtmd_context` for processing images and audio. During `process_input_items()`, the engine:

1. Creates audio/image decoder instances on-demand via `OdaiSdk::get_new_odai_audio_decoder_instance()` / `get_new_odai_image_decoder_instance()`
2. Decodes media files into raw pixel/PCM data using those decoders
3. Converts decoded data into `mtmd_bitmap` objects
4. The `mtmd` API then handles tokenizing text with media placeholders, encoding media into embeddings, and interleaving them in context

## Resource Management

All llama.cpp resources use `std::unique_ptr` with custom deleters (`LlamaModelDeleter`, `LlamaContextDeleter`, `LlamaSamplerDeleter`, `LlamaBatchDeleter`, `MtmdContextDeleter`) to ensure proper RAII cleanup.

Applications should release those resources through the normal SDK lifecycle (`OdaiSdk::shutdown()` / `odai_shutdown()`). The teardown rationale is documented in [`nuances.md`](../../nuances.md#explicit-sdk-shutdown-for-deterministic-backend-cleanup).

## Known Limitations

- Only supports **decoder-only** LLMs (no encoder-decoder models)
- Context window is currently hardcoded to 4096 tokens
- Reasoning tokens are not handled separately from normal tokens
- The `mtmd` API for multimodal is experimental
